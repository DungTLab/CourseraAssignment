  Springtime in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_Tho" target="_blank">Can Tho</a> is a peaceful and colorful season. 
  The gentle sunshine reflects on the Hau River, making every corner of the city sparkle with life. 
  Streets are filled with blooming flowers and the sound of boats drifting along the floating market.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes I walk along the riverside, other times I visit the small gardens near Ninh Kieu Wharf. 
  Can Tho also has many charming places to explore, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninh_Kieu_Quay" target="_blank">Ninh Kieu Quay</a> 
  and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cai_Rang_Floating_Market" target="_blank">Cai Rang Floating Market</a>. 
  Each visit reminds me how beautiful and lively this city becomes during springtime.
